# Python_Sucks

The Project was a part of our submission to the CodeChef AliBaba Hackathon 2018.

Currently it fetches, details of a user in a JSON string given a CodeChef username.

The Build is not stable. We are in process of testing.

We do not hate Python. Even if we did, Python would take a while to process it.
